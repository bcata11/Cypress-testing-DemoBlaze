# Cypress-testing-DemoBlaze

DemoBlaze is an e-commerce platform specialized in selling high-quality phones, laptops, and monitors. The website has a user-friendly interface, which facilitates both the search process through a wide selection of products and the purchasing process for users.

Here you can find some automated tests using cypress for an app called DemoBlaze.
There are 4 required tests and extra 2 that I perform.

I used faker for the sign up test to come up with a new username and password every time I run the tests.
